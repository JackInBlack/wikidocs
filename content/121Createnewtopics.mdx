**The more, the merrier...**

&nbsp;

Let's try creating a new topic now:

* Click the **Home** ribbon tab at the top of the window if it is not already selected
* Click the **Add topic** button in the **Table of contents** group
* That's it, your new topic has been created. You can now enter some content in it&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**That's all folks\!**

&nbsp;

You now know the basics of HelpNDoc and see how easy it is to create your documentation.

* You can now start your own project by using the File menu at the top then click New project
* You can learn more by reading HelpNDoc's documentation: click the help icon at the top right of the window
* Finally, you can contact us anytime if you have questions, concerns or praises about HelpNDoc by using the following form: [http://www.helpndoc.com/contact](<http://www.helpndoc.com/contact>)
