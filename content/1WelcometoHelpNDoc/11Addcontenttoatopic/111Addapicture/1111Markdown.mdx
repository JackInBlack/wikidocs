# 1.1.1. Add a picture

**Because "a picture is worth a thousand words"**

&nbsp;

Adding a picture to HelpNDoc is a two-step action:

* First we add it to the library
* Then we place it inside the topics

&nbsp;

HelpNDoc makes it straightforward by providing the Insert picture action which handles everything for you:

* Place your cursor below **Add your picture below...**
* Click the **Insert** ribbon tab at the top of the window
* Click the **Insert picture** button then **Insert another picture**
* Click the **No file included** link then choose **Include file**
* Choose your picture and click OK: your picture is inserted in the library and in the topic
* Once done, you can click the next topic: **Generate documentation**

&nbsp;

**Add your picture below...**
